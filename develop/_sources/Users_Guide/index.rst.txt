**Foreword: A note to METdatadb users**

This User's guide is provided as an aid to users of METdatadb.  METdatadb is a
Python rewrite of the capabilities in METviewer. The METviewer tool reads MET
verification statistics output from a database and creates plots using the R
statistical package. METdatadb is also a component of the unified METplus
verification framework. More details about METplus can be found on the
`METplus website <http://dtcenter.org/community-code/metplus>`_.

It is important to note here that METdatadb is an evolving software package.
This documentation describes the |release| release dated |release_date|.
Intermediate releases may include bug fixes. METdatadb is also able to accept
new modules contributed by the community. If you have code you would like to
contribute, we will gladly consider your contribution. Please send an email to:
`met_help@ucar.edu <mailto:>`__. We will then determine if we will be able to
include the contribution in a future version.

This User's Guide was prepared by the developers of METdatadb, including
Venita Hagerty, Tatiana Burek, John Halley Gotway, and Minna
Win-Gildenmeister.

to the staff at the Developmental Testbed Center for their help, advice,
and many types of support. We released METplus Alpha in February 2017
and would not have made a decade of cutting-edge verification support
without those who participated in DTC planning workshops and the NGGPS
United Forecast System Strategic Implementation Plan Working Groups
(NGGPS UFS SIP WGs).
